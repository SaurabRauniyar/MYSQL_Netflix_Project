## Overview

Overview

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing Netflix’s catalog of movies and TV shows using SQL. The dataset contains detailed information about titles available on Netflix, including content type, release year, country of production, ratings, duration, cast, director, and descriptive text.

The main purpose of this project is to practice real-world SQL querying by answering practical business-style questions. Instead of only retrieving data, the project emphasizes understanding patterns, trends, and distributions within Netflix’s content library. Each query is designed to solve a specific analytical problem, similar to what a data analyst might face in an actual work environment.

The analysis covers multiple aspects of the dataset, such as content growth over time, regional production trends, genre distribution, and keyword-based content classification.


## Objectives

The objectives of this project are:

• To understand the overall composition of Netflix content, including the balance between movies and TV shows
• To identify commonly occurring ratings and genres across different types of content
• To analyze how content is distributed across years and countries
• To examine actor and director participation in Netflix productions
• To practice advanced SQL concepts such as filtering, grouping, string manipulation, conditional logic, and date handling
• To categorize content using keyword analysis within textual descriptions

By the end of the project, the goal is to demonstrate strong SQL fundamentals along with the ability to translate business questions into meaningful database queries.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle and contains information about Netflix titles. Each record represents a single movie or TV show available on the platform.

The dataset includes attributes such as show ID, title, content type, director, cast, country of production, date added to Netflix, release year, rating, duration, genre classification, and description.

This dataset was chosen because it closely resembles real production data:
• It contains missing values
• Some columns store multiple values in a single field
• Dates are stored as text rather than proper date types

These characteristics make it ideal for practicing realistic data cleaning and querying scenarios using SQL.
